Although we did not interact with him that much, we felt like he had been trying his best to create an opened environment for all the students to get involved in activities as well as lectures. We love him!

                            <u>Description:</u> Not smart, but diligent, still sometimes lazy. Nam has zero experience about coding when he entered Drexel. Yet after first term at Drexel, Nam still has zero advanced knowledge about coding. But he always tries his best to complete Prof Kane's work. Nam lacks of time for study. But when he has, he still doesn't. He will wait untill when the deadline is due, so he can finish the work in 2 hours. This website was made in 2 hours (joking).

                            <u>Description:</u> Born in Madrid, De Gea began his career aged 13 with Atlético Madrid and rose through the academy system at the club before making his senior debut in 2009. After being made Atlético's first-choice goalkeeper, he helped the team win both the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2010. His performances attracted the attention of Manchester United, which he joined in June 2011 for £18.9 million, a British record for a goalkeeper at the time.
